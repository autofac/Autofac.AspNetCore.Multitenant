**Please ask questions on StackOverflow!**

Tag your question `autofac` and **do not double post here.**

Questions are things like "How do I...?", "Others have this working but I can't figure it out...," "Can you look at my code to see what I'm doing wrong?", and so on.

We monitor StackOverflow for `autofac` questions!

- Your question may help others - in issues, it's harder to find and can't help others.
- Lots of people monitor StackOverflow; many, many fewer can help you in issues.

First [check out our documentation](https://autofac.readthedocs.io) and if it's not answered there, head over to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and tag your question `autofac`.

**Questions as issues may be closed without explanation or warning.**
